X<__SUB__>

A special token that returns a reference to the current subroutine, or
L<C<undef>|/undef EXPR> outside of a subroutine.

The behaviour of L<C<__SUB__>|/__SUB__> within a regex code block (such
as C</(?{...})/>) is subject to change.

This token is only available under C<use v5.16> or the
L<C<"current_sub"> feature|feature/The 'current_sub' feature>.
See L<feature>.
