=item chdir

Changes the working directory to EXPR, if possible.  If EXPR is omitted,
changes to the directory specified by C<$ENV{HOME}>, if set; if not,
changes to the directory specified by C<$ENV{LOGDIR}>.  (Under VMS, the
variable C<$ENV{'SYS$LOGIN'}> is also checked, and used if it is set.)  If
neither is set, L<C<chdir>|/chdir EXPR> does nothing and fails.  It
returns true on success, false otherwise.  See the example under
L<C<die>|/die LIST>.

On systems that support L<fchdir(2)>, you may pass a filehandle or
directory handle as the argument.  On systems that don't support L<fchdir(2)>,
passing handles raises an exception.
