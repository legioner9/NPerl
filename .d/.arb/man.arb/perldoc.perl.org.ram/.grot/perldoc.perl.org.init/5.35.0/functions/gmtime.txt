=item gmtime

Works just like L<C<localtime>|/localtime EXPR>, but the returned values
are localized for the standard Greenwich time zone.

Note: When called in list context, $isdst, the last value
returned by gmtime, is always C<0>.  There is no
Daylight Saving Time in GMT.

Portability issues: L<perlport/gmtime>.
