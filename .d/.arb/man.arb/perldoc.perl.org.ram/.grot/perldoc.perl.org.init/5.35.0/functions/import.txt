=item import LIST
X<import>

There is no builtin L<C<import>|/import LIST> function.  It is just an
ordinary method (subroutine) defined (or inherited) by modules that wish
to export names to another module.  The
L<C<use>|/use Module VERSION LIST> function calls the
L<C<import>|/import LIST> method for the package used.  See also
L<C<use>|/use Module VERSION LIST>, L<perlmod>, and L<Exporter>.
