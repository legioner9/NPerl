=item int

Returns the integer portion of EXPR.  If EXPR is omitted, uses
L<C<$_>|perlvar/$_>.
You should not use this function for rounding: one because it truncates
towards C<0>, and two because machine representations of floating-point
numbers can sometimes produce counterintuitive results.  For example,
C<int(-6.725/0.025)> produces -268 rather than the correct -269; that's
because it's really more like -268.99999999999994315658 instead.  Usually,
the L<C<sprintf>|/sprintf FORMAT, LIST>,
L<C<printf>|/printf FILEHANDLE FORMAT, LIST>, or the
L<C<POSIX::floor>|POSIX/C<floor>> and L<C<POSIX::ceil>|POSIX/C<ceil>>
functions will serve you better than will L<C<int>|/int EXPR>.
