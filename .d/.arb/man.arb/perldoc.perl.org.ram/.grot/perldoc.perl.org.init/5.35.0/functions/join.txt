=item join EXPR,LIST
X<join>

Joins the separate strings of LIST into a single string with fields
separated by the value of EXPR, and returns that new string.  Example:

   my $rec = join(':', $login,$passwd,$uid,$gid,$gcos,$home,$shell);

Beware that unlike L<C<split>|/split E<sol>PATTERNE<sol>,EXPR,LIMIT>,
L<C<join>|/join EXPR,LIST> doesn't take a pattern as its first argument.
Compare L<C<split>|/split E<sol>PATTERNE<sol>,EXPR,LIMIT>.
