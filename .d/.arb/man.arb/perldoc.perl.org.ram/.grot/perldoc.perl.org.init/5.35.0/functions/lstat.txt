Does the same thing as the L<C<stat>|/stat FILEHANDLE> function
(including setting the special C<_> filehandle) but stats a symbolic
link instead of the file the symbolic link points to.  If symbolic links
are unimplemented on your system, a normal L<C<stat>|/stat FILEHANDLE>
is done.  For much more detailed information, please see the
documentation for L<C<stat>|/stat FILEHANDLE>.

If EXPR is omitted, stats L<C<$_>|perlvar/$_>.

Portability issues: L<perlport/lstat>.
