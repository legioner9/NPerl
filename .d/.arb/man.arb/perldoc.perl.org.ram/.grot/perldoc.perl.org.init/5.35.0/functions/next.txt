=item next

The L<C<next>|/next LABEL> command is like the C<continue> statement in
C; it starts the next iteration of the loop:

    LINE: while (<STDIN>) {
        next LINE if /^#/;  # discard comments
        #...
    }

Note that if there were a L<C<continue>|/continue BLOCK> block on the
above, it would get
executed even on discarded lines.  If LABEL is omitted, the command
refers to the innermost enclosing loop.  The C<next EXPR> form, available
as of Perl 5.18.0, allows a label name to be computed at run time, being
otherwise identical to C<next LABEL>.

L<C<next>|/next LABEL> cannot return a value from a block that typically
returns a value, such as C<eval {}>, C<sub {}>, or C<do {}>. It will perform
its flow control behavior, which precludes any return value. It should not be
used to exit a L<C<grep>|/grep BLOCK LIST> or L<C<map>|/map BLOCK LIST>
operation.

Note that a block by itself is semantically identical to a loop
that executes once.  Thus L<C<next>|/next LABEL> will exit such a block
early.

See also L<C<continue>|/continue BLOCK> for an illustration of how
L<C<last>|/last LABEL>, L<C<next>|/next LABEL>, and
L<C<redo>|/redo LABEL> work.

Unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as assignment.
It is also exempt from the looks-like-a-function rule, so
C<next ("foo")."bar"> will cause "bar" to be part of the argument to
L<C<next>|/next LABEL>.
