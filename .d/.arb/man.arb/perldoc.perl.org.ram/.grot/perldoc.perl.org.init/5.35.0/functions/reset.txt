=item reset

Generally used in a L<C<continue>|/continue BLOCK> block at the end of a
loop to clear variables and reset C<m?pattern?> searches so that they
work again.  The
expression is interpreted as a list of single characters (hyphens
allowed for ranges).  All variables (scalars, arrays, and hashes)
in the current package beginning with one of
those letters are reset to their pristine state.  If the expression is
omitted, one-match searches (C<m?pattern?>) are reset to match again.
Only resets variables or searches in the current package.  Always returns
1.  Examples:

    reset 'X';      # reset all X variables
    reset 'a-z';    # reset lower case variables
    reset;          # just reset m?one-time? searches

Resetting C<"A-Z"> is not recommended because you'll wipe out your
L<C<@ARGV>|perlvar/@ARGV> and L<C<@INC>|perlvar/@INC> arrays and your
L<C<%ENV>|perlvar/%ENV> hash.

Resets only package variables; lexical variables are unaffected, but
they clean themselves up on scope exit anyway, so you'll probably want
to use them instead.  See L<C<my>|/my VARLIST>.
