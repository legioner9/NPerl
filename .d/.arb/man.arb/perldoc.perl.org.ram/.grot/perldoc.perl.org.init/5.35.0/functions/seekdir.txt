=item seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS
X<seekdir>

Sets the current position for the L<C<readdir>|/readdir DIRHANDLE>
routine on DIRHANDLE.  POS must be a value returned by
L<C<telldir>|/telldir DIRHANDLE>.  L<C<seekdir>|/seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS>
also has the same caveats about possible directory compaction as the
corresponding system library routine.
