=item send SOCKET,MSG,FLAGS

Sends a message on a socket.  Attempts to send the scalar MSG to the SOCKET
filehandle.  Takes the same flags as the system call of the same name.  On
unconnected sockets, you must specify a destination to I<send to>, in which
case it does a L<sendto(2)> syscall.  Returns the number of characters sent,
or the undefined value on error.  The L<sendmsg(2)> syscall is currently
unimplemented.  See L<perlipc/"UDP: Message Passing"> for examples.

Note that if the socket has been marked as C<:utf8>, C<send> will
throw an exception.  The C<:encoding(...)> layer implicitly introduces
the C<:utf8> layer.  See L<C<binmode>|/binmode FILEHANDLE, LAYER>.
