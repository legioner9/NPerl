=item socket SOCKET,DOMAIN,TYPE,PROTOCOL
X<socket>

Opens a socket of the specified kind and attaches it to filehandle
SOCKET.  DOMAIN, TYPE, and PROTOCOL are specified the same as for
the syscall of the same name.  You should C<use Socket> first
to get the proper definitions imported.  See the examples in
L<perlipc/"Sockets: Client/Server Communication">.

On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the flag will
be set for the newly opened file descriptor, as determined by the
value of L<C<$^F>|perlvar/$^F>.  See L<perlvar/$^F>.
