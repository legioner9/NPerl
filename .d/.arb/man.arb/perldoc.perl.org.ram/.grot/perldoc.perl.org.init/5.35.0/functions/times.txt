X<times>

Returns a four-element list giving the user and system times in
seconds for this process and any exited children of this process.

    my ($user,$system,$cuser,$csystem) = times;

In scalar context, L<C<times>|/times> returns C<$user>.

Children's times are only included for terminated children.

Portability issues: L<perlport/times>.
