=item $POSTMATCH

=item $'
X<$'> X<$POSTMATCH> X<${^POSTMATCH}> X<@->

The string following whatever was matched by the last successful
pattern match (not counting any matches hidden within a BLOCK or C<eval()>
enclosed by the current BLOCK).  Example:

    local $_ = 'abcdefghi';
    /def/;
    print "$`:$&:$'\n";  	# prints abc:def:ghi

See L</Performance issues> above for the serious performance implications
of using this variable (even once) in your code.

This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.

Mnemonic: C<'> often follows a quoted string.
