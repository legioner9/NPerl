=item $EVAL_ERROR

=item $@
X<$@> X<$EVAL_ERROR>

The Perl error from the last C<eval> operator, i.e. the last exception that
was caught.  For C<eval BLOCK>, this is either a runtime error message or the
string or reference C<die> was called with.  The C<eval STRING> form also
catches syntax errors and other compile time exceptions.

If no error occurs, C<eval> sets C<$@> to the empty string.

Warning messages are not collected in this variable.  You can, however,
set up a routine to process warnings by setting C<$SIG{__WARN__}> as
described in L</%SIG>.

Mnemonic: Where was the error "at"?
