=item $\
X<$\> X<$ORS> X<$OUTPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR>

The output record separator for the print operator.  If defined, this
value is printed after the last of print's arguments.  Default is C<undef>.

You cannot call C<output_record_separator()> on a handle, only as a
static method.  See L<IO::Handle|IO::Handle>.

Mnemonic: you set C<$\> instead of adding "\n" at the end of the print.
Also, it's just like C<$/>, but it's what you get "back" from Perl.
