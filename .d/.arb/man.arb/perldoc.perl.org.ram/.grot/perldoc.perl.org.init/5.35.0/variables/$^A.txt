X<$^A> X<$ACCUMULATOR>

The current value of the C<write()> accumulator for C<format()> lines.
A format contains C<formline()> calls that put their result into
C<$^A>.  After calling its format, C<write()> prints out the contents
of C<$^A> and empties.  So you never really see the contents of C<$^A>
unless you call C<formline()> yourself and then look at it.  See
L<perlform> and L<perlfunc/"formline PICTURE,LIST">.
