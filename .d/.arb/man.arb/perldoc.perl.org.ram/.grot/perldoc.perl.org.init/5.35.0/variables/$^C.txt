=item $COMPILING

=item $^C
X<$^C> X<$COMPILING>

The current value of the flag associated with the B<-c> switch.
Mainly of use with B<-MO=...> to allow code to alter its behavior
when being compiled, such as for example to C<AUTOLOAD> at compile
time rather than normal, deferred loading.  Setting
C<$^C = 1> is similar to calling C<B::minus_c>.

This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.
