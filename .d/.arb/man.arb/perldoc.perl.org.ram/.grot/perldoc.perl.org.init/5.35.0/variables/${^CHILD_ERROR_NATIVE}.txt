=item ${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}
X<$^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE>

The native status returned by the last pipe close, backtick (C<``>)
command, successful call to C<wait()> or C<waitpid()>, or from the
C<system()> operator.  On POSIX-like systems this value can be decoded
with the WIFEXITED, WEXITSTATUS, WIFSIGNALED, WTERMSIG, WIFSTOPPED, and
WSTOPSIG functions provided by the L<POSIX> module.

Under VMS this reflects the actual VMS exit status; i.e. it is the
same as C<$?> when the pragma C<use vmsish 'status'> is in effect.

This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.
