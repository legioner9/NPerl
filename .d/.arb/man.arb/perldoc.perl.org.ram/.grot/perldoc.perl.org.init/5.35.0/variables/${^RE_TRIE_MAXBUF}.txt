=item ${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}
X<${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}>

Controls how certain regex optimisations are applied and how much memory they
utilize.  This value by default is 65536 which corresponds to a 512kB
temporary cache.  Set this to a higher value to trade
memory for speed when matching large alternations.  Set
it to a lower value if you want the optimisations to
be as conservative of memory as possible but still occur, and set it to a
negative value to prevent the optimisation and conserve the most memory.
Under normal situations this variable should be of no interest to you.

This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.
