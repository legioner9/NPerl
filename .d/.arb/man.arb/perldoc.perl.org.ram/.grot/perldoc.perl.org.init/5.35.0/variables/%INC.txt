=item %INC
X<%INC>

The hash C<%INC> contains entries for each filename included via the
C<do>, C<require>, or C<use> operators.  The key is the filename
you specified (with module names converted to pathnames), and the
value is the location of the file found.  The C<require>
operator uses this hash to determine whether a particular file has
already been included.

If the file was loaded via a hook (e.g. a subroutine reference, see
L<perlfunc/require> for a description of these hooks), this hook is
by default inserted into C<%INC> in place of a filename.  Note, however,
that the hook may have set the C<%INC> entry by itself to provide some more
specific info.
