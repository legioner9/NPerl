X<%+> X<%LAST_PAREN_MATCH> X<%{^CAPTURE}>

Similar to C<@+>, the C<%+> hash allows access to the named capture
buffers, should they exist, in the last successful match in the
currently active dynamic scope.

For example, C<$+{foo}> is equivalent to C<$1> after the following match:

    'foo' =~ /(?<foo>foo)/;

The keys of the C<%+> hash list only the names of buffers that have
captured (and that are thus associated to defined values).

If multiple distinct capture groups have the same name, then
C<$+{NAME}> will refer to the leftmost defined group in the match.

The underlying behaviour of C<%+> is provided by the
L<Tie::Hash::NamedCapture> module.

B<Note:> C<%-> and C<%+> are tied views into a common internal hash
associated with the last successful regular expression.  Therefore mixing
iterative access to them via C<each> may have unpredictable results.
Likewise, if the last successful match changes, then the results may be
surprising.

This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0. The C<%{^CAPTURE}> alias was
added in 5.25.7.

This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.
