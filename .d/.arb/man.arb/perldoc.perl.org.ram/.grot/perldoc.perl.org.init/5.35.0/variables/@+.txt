X<@+> X<@LAST_MATCH_END>

This array holds the offsets of the ends of the last successful
submatches in the currently active dynamic scope.  C<$+[0]> is
the offset into the string of the end of the entire match.  This
is the same value as what the C<pos> function returns when called
on the variable that was matched against.  The I<n>th element
of this array holds the offset of the I<n>th submatch, so
C<$+[1]> is the offset past where C<$1> ends, C<$+[2]> the offset
past where C<$2> ends, and so on.  You can use C<$#+> to determine
how many subgroups were in the last successful match.  See the
examples given for the C<@-> variable.

This variable was added in Perl v5.6.0.
