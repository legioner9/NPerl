=item @INC
X<@INC>

The array C<@INC> contains the list of places that the C<do EXPR>,
C<require>, or C<use> constructs look for their library files.  It
initially consists of the arguments to any B<-I> command-line
switches, followed by the default Perl library, probably
F</usr/local/lib/perl>.
Prior to Perl 5.26, C<.> -which represents the current directory, was included
in C<@INC>; it has been removed. This change in behavior is documented
in L<C<PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC>|perlrun/PERL_USE_UNSAFE_INC> and it is
not recommended that C<.> be re-added to C<@INC>.
If you need to modify C<@INC> at runtime, you should use the C<use lib> pragma
to get the machine-dependent library properly loaded as well:

    use lib '/mypath/libdir/';
    use SomeMod;

You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by putting Perl
code directly into C<@INC>.  Those hooks may be subroutine references,
array references or blessed objects.  See L<perlfunc/require> for details.
