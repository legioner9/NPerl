=item accept NEWSOCKET,GENERICSOCKET
X<accept>

Accepts an incoming socket connect, just as L<accept(2)>
does.  Returns the packed address if it succeeded, false otherwise.
See the example in L<perlipc/"Sockets: Client/Server Communication">.

On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the flag will
be set for the newly opened file descriptor, as determined by the
value of L<C<$^F>|perlvar/$^F>.  See L<perlvar/$^F>.
