=item index STR,SUBSTR

The index function searches for one string within another, but without
the wildcard-like behavior of a full regular-expression pattern match.
It returns the position of the first occurrence of SUBSTR in STR at
or after POSITION.  If POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the
beginning of the string.  POSITION before the beginning of the string
or after its end is treated as if it were the beginning or the end,
respectively.  POSITION and the return value are based at zero.
If the substring is not found, L<C<index>|/index STR,SUBSTR,POSITION>
returns -1.

Find characters or strings:

    index("Perl is great", "P");     # Returns 0
    index("Perl is great", "g");     # Returns 8
    index("Perl is great", "great"); # Also returns 8

Attempting to find something not there:

    index("Perl is great", "Z");     # Returns -1 (not found)

Using an offset to find the I<second> occurrence:

    index("Perl is great", "e", 5);  # Returns 10
