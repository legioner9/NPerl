=item lcfirst

Returns the value of EXPR with the first character lowercased.  This
is the internal function implementing the C<\l> escape in
double-quoted strings.

If EXPR is omitted, uses L<C<$_>|perlvar/$_>.

This function behaves the same way under various pragmas, such as in a locale,
as L<C<lc>|/lc EXPR> does.
