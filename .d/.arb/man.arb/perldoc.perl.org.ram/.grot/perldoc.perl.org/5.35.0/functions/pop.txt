=item pop

Pops and returns the last value of the array, shortening the array by
one element.

Returns the undefined value if the array is empty, although this may
also happen at other times.  If ARRAY is omitted, pops the
L<C<@ARGV>|perlvar/@ARGV> array in the main program, but the
L<C<@_>|perlvar/@_> array in subroutines, just like
L<C<shift>|/shift ARRAY>.

Starting with Perl 5.14, an experimental feature allowed
L<C<pop>|/pop ARRAY> to take a
scalar expression. This experiment has been deemed unsuccessful, and was
removed as of Perl 5.24.
