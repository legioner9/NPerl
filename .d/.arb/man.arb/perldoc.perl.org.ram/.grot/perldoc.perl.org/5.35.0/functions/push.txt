=item push ARRAY,LIST
X<push> X<stack>

Treats ARRAY as a stack by appending the values of LIST to the end of
ARRAY.  The length of ARRAY increases by the length of LIST.  Has the same
effect as

    for my $value (LIST) {
        $ARRAY[++$#ARRAY] = $value;
    }

but is more efficient.  Returns the number of elements in the array following
the completed L<C<push>|/push ARRAY,LIST>.

Starting with Perl 5.14, an experimental feature allowed
L<C<push>|/push ARRAY,LIST> to take a
scalar expression. This experiment has been deemed unsuccessful, and was
removed as of Perl 5.24.
