=item rename OLDNAME,NEWNAME
X<rename> X<move> X<mv> X<ren>

Changes the name of a file; an existing file NEWNAME will be
clobbered.  Returns true for success; on failure returns false and sets
L<C<$!>|perlvar/$!>.

Behavior of this function varies wildly depending on your system
implementation.  For example, it will usually not work across file system
boundaries, even though the system I<mv> command sometimes compensates
for this.  Other restrictions include whether it works on directories,
open files, or pre-existing files.  Check L<perlport> and either the
L<rename(2)> manpage or equivalent system documentation for details.

For a platform independent L<C<move>|File::Copy/move> function look at
the L<File::Copy> module.

Portability issues: L<perlport/rename>.
