Just like L<C<print>|/print FILEHANDLE LIST>, but implicitly appends a
newline at the end of the LIST instead of any value L<C<$\>|perlvar/$\>
might have.  To use FILEHANDLE without a LIST to
print the contents of L<C<$_>|perlvar/$_> to it, you must use a bareword
filehandle like C<FH>, not an indirect one like C<$fh>.

L<C<say>|/say FILEHANDLE LIST> is available only if the
L<C<"say"> feature|feature/The 'say' feature> is enabled or if it is
prefixed with C<CORE::>.  The
L<C<"say"> feature|feature/The 'say' feature> is enabled automatically
with a C<use v5.10> (or higher) declaration in the current scope.
