=item setpgrp PID,PGRP
X<setpgrp> X<group>

Sets the current process group for the specified PID, C<0> for the current
process.  Raises an exception when used on a machine that doesn't
implement POSIX L<setpgid(2)> or BSD L<setpgrp(2)>.  If the arguments
are omitted, it defaults to C<0,0>.  Note that the BSD 4.2 version of
L<C<setpgrp>|/setpgrp PID,PGRP> does not accept any arguments, so only
C<setpgrp(0,0)> is portable.  See also
L<C<POSIX::setsid()>|POSIX/C<setsid>>.

Portability issues: L<perlport/setpgrp>.
