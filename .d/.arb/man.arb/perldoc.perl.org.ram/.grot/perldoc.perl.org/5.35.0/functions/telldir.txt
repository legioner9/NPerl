=item telldir DIRHANDLE
X<telldir>

Returns the current position of the L<C<readdir>|/readdir DIRHANDLE>
routines on DIRHANDLE.  Value may be given to
L<C<seekdir>|/seekdir DIRHANDLE,POS> to access a particular location in
a directory.  L<C<telldir>|/telldir DIRHANDLE> has the same caveats
about possible directory compaction as the corresponding system library
routine.
