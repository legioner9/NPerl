=item ucfirst

Returns the value of EXPR with the first character in uppercase
(titlecase in Unicode).  This is the internal function implementing
the C<\u> escape in double-quoted strings.

If EXPR is omitted, uses L<C<$_>|perlvar/$_>.

This function behaves the same way under various pragmas, such as in a locale,
as L<C<lc>|/lc EXPR> does.
