=item unlink

Deletes a list of files.  On success, it returns the number of files
it successfully deleted.  On failure, it returns false and sets
L<C<$!>|perlvar/$!> (errno):

    my $unlinked = unlink 'a', 'b', 'c';
    unlink @goners;
    unlink glob "*.bak";

On error, L<C<unlink>|/unlink LIST> will not tell you which files it
could not remove.
If you want to know which files you could not remove, try them one
at a time:

     foreach my $file ( @goners ) {
         unlink $file or warn "Could not unlink $file: $!";
     }

Note: L<C<unlink>|/unlink LIST> will not attempt to delete directories
unless you are
superuser and the B<-U> flag is supplied to Perl.  Even if these
conditions are met, be warned that unlinking a directory can inflict
damage on your filesystem.  Finally, using L<C<unlink>|/unlink LIST> on
directories is not supported on many operating systems.  Use
L<C<rmdir>|/rmdir FILENAME> instead.

If LIST is omitted, L<C<unlink>|/unlink LIST> uses L<C<$_>|perlvar/$_>.
