=item unshift ARRAY,LIST
X<unshift>

Does the opposite of a L<C<shift>|/shift ARRAY>.  Or the opposite of a
L<C<push>|/push ARRAY,LIST>,
depending on how you look at it.  Prepends list to the front of the
array and returns the new number of elements in the array.

    unshift(@ARGV, '-e') unless $ARGV[0] =~ /^-/;

Note the LIST is prepended whole, not one element at a time, so the
prepended elements stay in the same order.  Use
L<C<reverse>|/reverse LIST> to do the reverse.

Starting with Perl 5.14, an experimental feature allowed
L<C<unshift>|/unshift ARRAY,LIST> to take
a scalar expression. This experiment has been deemed unsuccessful, and was
removed as of Perl 5.24.
