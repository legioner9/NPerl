When an array or an array slice is interpolated into a double-quoted
string or a similar context such as C</.../>, its elements are
separated by this value.  Default is a space.  For example, this:

    print "The array is: @array\n";

is equivalent to this:

    print "The array is: " . join($", @array) . "\n";

Mnemonic: works in double-quoted context.
