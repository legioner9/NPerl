=item $*
X<$*>

C<$*> was a variable that you could use to enable multiline matching.
After a deprecation cycle, its magic was removed in Perl v5.10.0.
Using it now triggers a warning: C<$* is no longer supported>.
You should use the C</s> and C</m> regexp modifiers instead.

Deprecated in Perl 5.

Removed in Perl v5.10.0.
