=item $^S
X<$^S> X<$EXCEPTIONS_BEING_CAUGHT>

Current state of the interpreter.

	$^S         State
	---------   -------------------------------------
	undef       Parsing module, eval, or main program
	true (1)    Executing an eval
	false (0)   Otherwise

The first state may happen in C<$SIG{__DIE__}> and C<$SIG{__WARN__}>
handlers.

The English name $EXCEPTIONS_BEING_CAUGHT is slightly misleading, because
the C<undef> value does not indicate whether exceptions are being caught,
since compilation of the main program does not catch exceptions.

This variable was added in Perl 5.004.
