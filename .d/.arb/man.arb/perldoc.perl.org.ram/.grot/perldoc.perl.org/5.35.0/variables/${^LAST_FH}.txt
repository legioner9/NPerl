=item ${^LAST_FH}
X<${^LAST_FH}>

This read-only variable contains a reference to the last-read filehandle.
This is set by C<< <HANDLE> >>, C<readline>, C<tell>, C<eof> and C<seek>.
This is the same handle that C<$.> and C<tell> and C<eof> without arguments
use.  It is also the handle used when Perl appends ", <STDIN> line 1" to
an error or warning message.

This variable was added in Perl v5.18.0.
