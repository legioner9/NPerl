=item ${^POSTMATCH}
X<${^POSTMATCH}> X<$'> X<$POSTMATCH>

This is similar to C<$'> (C<$POSTMATCH>) except that it does not incur the
performance penalty associated with that variable.

See L</Performance issues> above.

In Perl v5.18 and earlier, it is only guaranteed
to return a defined value when the pattern was compiled or executed with
the C</p> modifier.  In Perl v5.20, the C</p> modifier does nothing, so
C<${^POSTMATCH}> does the same thing as C<$POSTMATCH>.

This variable was added in Perl v5.10.0.

This variable is read-only and dynamically-scoped.
