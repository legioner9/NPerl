=item ${^UTF8CACHE}
X<${^UTF8CACHE}>

This variable controls the state of the internal UTF-8 offset caching code.
1 for on (the default), 0 for off, -1 to debug the caching code by checking
all its results against linear scans, and panicking on any discrepancy.

This variable was added in Perl v5.8.9.  It is subject to change or
removal without notice, but is currently used to avoid recalculating the
boundaries of multi-byte UTF-8-encoded characters.
