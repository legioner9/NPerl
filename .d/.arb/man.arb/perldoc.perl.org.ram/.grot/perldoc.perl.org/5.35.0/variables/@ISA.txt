X<@ISA>

Each package contains a special array called C<@ISA> which contains a list
of that class's parent classes, if any. This array is simply a list of
scalars, each of which is a string that corresponds to a package name. The
array is examined when Perl does method resolution, which is covered in
L<perlobj>.

To load packages while adding them to C<@ISA>, see the L<parent> pragma. The
discouraged L<base> pragma does this as well, but should not be used except
when compatibility with the discouraged L<fields> pragma is required.
