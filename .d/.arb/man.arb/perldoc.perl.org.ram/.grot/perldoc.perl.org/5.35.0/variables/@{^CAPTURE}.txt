=item @{^CAPTURE}
X<@{^CAPTURE}> X<@^CAPTURE>

An array which exposes the contents of the capture buffers, if any, of
the last successful pattern match, not counting patterns matched
in nested blocks that have been exited already.

Note that the 0 index of @{^CAPTURE} is equivalent to $1, the 1 index
is equivalent to $2, etc.

    if ("foal"=~/(.)(.)(.)(.)/) {
        print join "-", @{^CAPTURE};
    }

should output "f-o-a-l".

See also L<<< /$<I<digits>> ($1, $2, ...) >>>, L</%{^CAPTURE}> and
L</%{^CAPTURE_ALL}>.

Note that unlike most other regex magic variables there is no single
letter equivalent to C<@{^CAPTURE}>.

This variable was added in 5.25.7
