=item ARGV
X<ARGV>

The special filehandle that iterates over command-line filenames in
C<@ARGV>.  Usually written as the null filehandle in the angle operator
C<< <> >>.  Note that currently C<ARGV> only has its magical effect
within the C<< <> >> operator; elsewhere it is just a plain filehandle
corresponding to the last file opened by C<< <> >>.  In particular,
passing C<\*ARGV> as a parameter to a function that expects a filehandle
may not cause your function to automatically read the contents of all the
files in C<@ARGV>.
